# Decision log — ARN-462 (image break)

**Decision:** The Docker death on #500/#501 is `chain_github_ready`, not `chain_file_ready`.
**Came up because:** The build.sh echo prints `Building chain_file_ready` immediately before `Building chain_github_ready`. The getrandom `compile_error!` is in the second crate's unit graph (`rsa` → `rand_core` → getrandom 0.2.17). `chain_file_ready` has the same `temper-wasm-sdk` pin and does not pull getrandom; it compiles on rust 1.94.
**Options:** (1) add getrandom `custom` to every new chain crate; (2) add it only to crates that pull getrandom; (3) enable getrandom `js`.
**Chose (2) over (1) and (3) because:** (1) forces every crate to register a backend or fail to link. (3) pulls wasm-bindgen, which this host forbids. What we gave up: a crate that later grows an accidental getrandom dep still needs the stub; the rsa lint catches the known class, not every future transitive.
**Where:** `os-apps/paw-patrol/wasm/chain_github_ready/Cargo.toml`; Docker run 33900344300.

---

**Decision:** Same crate-local getrandom `custom` stub as `release_run_lifecycle`. Do not put it on `wasm-helpers`. Do not migrate patrol to wasip1 in this change.
**Came up because:** ARN-460 already chose this stub and recorded that the door crate omitted it. ARN-443 is the regression from putting getrandom on helpers. ARN-447 is the wasip1 migration.
**Options:** (1) helpers; (2) wasip1 for all patrol modules; (3) copy the existing stub onto the door.
**Chose (3) over (1) and (2) because:** (1) is the known break. (2) is a different issue with its own Linear. What we gave up: patrol stays on the forbidden-by-policy unknown-unknown target until ARN-447.
**Where:** `chain_github_ready/src/lib.rs`; `release_run_lifecycle/src/github_app.rs`.

---

**Decision:** Encode the class on the PR `checks` path with a lint plus `cargo check` of the two rsa crates, not a full os-app `build.sh`.
**Came up because:** ARN-429 keeps full wasm builds off PRs so checks stay under five minutes. That is why #500/#501 CI was green and Docker was red.
**Options:** (1) run patrol `build.sh` on every PR; (2) lint only; (3) lint plus `cargo check` of the rsa crates on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
**Chose (3) over (1) and (2) because:** (1) blows the PR budget. (2) would miss a stub that is declared but does not link. What we gave up: a non-rsa crate that newly pulls getrandom 0.2 still only fails in Docker/`full`.
**Where:** `scripts/check-wasm-rsa-getrandom.sh`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

**Decision:** TemperDeploy waits for the GHCR tag before writing Railway IMAGE_TAG.
**Came up because:** "Do not Request until Docker has pushed" lived in chat. Request assumed the image existed and would swap a missing tag, then sit in Polling until rollback.
**Options:** (1) keep the wait in the agent; (2) Fail Request when GHCR 404s; (3) WaitingForImage self-loop, swap only on ImageReady.
**Chose (3) over (1) and (2) because:** (1) is the hole. (2) fails a Request issued while Docker is still running. What we gave up: first Request after this lands still needs the new wasm in the image or a Genesis install; the old machine cannot wait.
**Where:** `temper_deploy.ioa.toml`; `temper_deploy_lifecycle` `wait_image`.

---

**Decision:** 455 proof is a ContractProbe row, not a bench inside TemperDeploy. CheckHealthy fires RunScan. Ready re-runs every 6h.
**Came up because:** Re-measuring DesignLanguages was parked as "not deploy." Rita named it a LatencyDiag-class tool that also watches for worsening.
**Options:** (1) put curl into TemperDeploy.Check; (2) generalize LatencyDiag's hardcoded DSF Datadog command; (3) a patrol ContractProbe (same shape as LatencyDiag: RunScan, no caller params, pinned path/filter/max_ms).
**Chose (3) over (1) and (2) because:** (1) mixes deploy with measurement. (2) is computer_exec + Datadog; the 455 signal is OData on this MCP. What we gave up: LatencyDiag stays the DSF prototype until someone parameterizes it.
**Where:** `contract_probe.ioa.toml`; TemperDeploy CheckHealthy `temper_healthy_runs_probe`.

---

**Decision:** RunScan is permitted for timeout-scheduler, wasm-runtime, and patrol-release-service. Create stays Admin/Agent.
**Came up because:** CheckHealthy inherits wasm-runtime unless elevated. Ready/Failed timeouts fire as timeout-scheduler. The first Cedar draft only allowed Admin/Agent for RunScan, so the schedule and the Healthy callback would deny.
**Options:** (1) leave RunScan as Agent-only and tell the next session to fire it by hand; (2) permit the dispatchers on RunScan and elevate CheckHealthy to patrol-release-service; (3) put the curl inside TemperDeploy.
**Chose (2) over (1) and (3) because:** (1) is the hole Rita named. (3) was already rejected. What we gave up: a wider RunScan permit than create.
**Where:** `policies/patrol.cedar`; `temper_deploy.ioa.toml` `temper_healthy_runs_probe`.

---

**Decision:** GHCR wait exchanges a scoped pull token at `/token` before reading the manifest.
**Came up because:** Review of 4cc6601ef: a GitHub PAT as the registry bearer returns 401 on private GHCR. Request would Fail instead of wait.
**Options:** (1) keep PAT-as-bearer; (2) GET `ghcr.io/token?service=ghcr.io&scope=repository:name:pull` then use that token; (3) skip wait and stay in chat.
**Chose (2) over (1) and (3) because:** (1) is the hole. (3) is the hole Rita named. What we gave up: one extra HTTP call per CheckImage.
**Where:** `temper_deploy_lifecycle` `ghcr_pull_token`.

---

**Decision:** ContractProbe `http_call` and `access_secret` are permitted by module identity, same as the other patrol HTTP modules. A non-OData body is RunFailed, not passed=true with 0 rows.
**Came up because:** The Agent-only http_call permit does not cover wasm-runtime / patrol-release-service. A 200 HTML body was counted as 0 rows and could pass the 800ms contract.
**Options:** (1) leave it; (2) add the module to the principal-agnostic permits and fail closed on parse.
**Chose (2) because:** (1) is a silent miss after Healthy.
**Where:** `policies/patrol.cedar`; `contract_probe` `odata_row_count`.
