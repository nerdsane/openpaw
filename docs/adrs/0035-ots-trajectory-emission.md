# ADR-0035: OTS Trajectory Emission from paw-agent Sessions

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Amended:** 2026-08-11 — sections 9-18 (ARN-109: real turns, decisions, content, and the completeness of what is stored)
**Related:** ADR-0005 (Temper-Native Orchestration), ADR-0015 (Convergence Analyst), ADR-0022 (LLM Calling Infrastructure Optimizations), ADR-0032 (TemperFS Agent Operations), ADR-0034 (Bounded Session Context and LLM Turn Decomposition)

## Context

Three trajectory layers exist in the OpenPaw + Temper stack today, each answering a different question:

1. **Temper action trajectories** — `record_dispatch_trajectory` writes one row per state-machine action dispatch to the Turso `trajectories` table. Captures action name, from→to status, success, error, agent_id, session_id. Answers: "what actions did the session machine execute?"
2. **OpenTelemetry spans** — `llm_caller` / `provider_caller` emit OTel spans with `gen_ai_parent_trace_id` / `gen_ai_parent_span_id`. Captures latency and call hierarchy. Answers: "how did this call perform?"
3. **OTS (Open Trajectory Specification)** — `temper-ots` crate defines the data model (`OTSTrajectory`, `OTSTurn`, `OTSDecision`). The Turso `ots_trajectories` table and `POST`/`GET /api/ots/trajectories` endpoints exist. Answers: "what did the agent decide, and why?"

Layer 3 has zero production writers today. The schema, endpoint, storage, and query surface are all in place and unused. paw-foresight's Convergence Analyst (ADR-0015) can only compare probe Observations — not the tool-call paths that produced them — which caps its ability to distinguish independent convergence from copy-paste convergence across probes. Rita's foresight Run 000-010 baseline has identified this as a core limitation of rubric v3 scoring.

This ADR is about becoming the first producer for Layer 3.

## Decision

### 1. Batch-on-completion emission from a new WASM module

A new WASM module `emit_ots_trajectory` fires when the Session entity enters `Completed`, `Failed`, or `Cancelled`. It reads the session's JSONL turn tree and per-session tool-span JSONL, assembles an `OTSTrajectory` document, and POSTs it to `{temper_api_url}/api/ots/trajectories` with `X-Agent-Id`, `X-Session-Id`, `X-Tenant-Id`, `X-Trajectory-Id` headers.

The module is declared as a standalone integration alongside `deliver_reply` on the same terminal-state effects — reply delivery and trajectory emission run independently. Trajectory emission failure cannot poison reply delivery.

Per-turn incremental OTS writes were considered and rejected: the endpoint expects full trajectory documents, per-turn incremental emission would require either a new endpoint (duplicates platform concern) or many-small-writes pattern that breaks idempotency on retry.

### 2. Tool spans persisted as TemperFS JSONL, not inline entity fields

Today `monty_repl` collects `tool_span_events: Vec<Value>` per turn and passes it as the `_dd_llmobs_tool_spans` callback param. The Vec is discarded between turns — no downstream consumer reads the param. Nothing on the Session entity preserves a session-level tool-call history.

To give the emitter something to convert, a new Session state variable `tool_spans_file_id` (string, initial `""`) references a single TemperFS JSONL file per session. `monty_repl` appends one line per tool call per turn. The file grows monotonically and is read once at terminal-state emission.

Alternatives rejected:
- **Inline `tool_spans` field on the Session entity.** Breaks the 32KB WASM visibility ceiling after roughly 15 turns of large tool outputs.
- **Separate `ToolSpan` entity per call with session_id FK.** Requires a new IOA spec, Cedar policies, list queries on Completed, and N additional round-trips for write-once data. Pure overhead.
- **Keep the callback-param-only path and pass the full Vec into the emitter on terminal state.** Vec reconstruction across turns requires some persistence anyway, so this is actually option 1 in disguise.

The TemperFS file mirrors the existing `session_file_id` (conversation-tree JSONL) pattern and reuses the `max_sync_file_bytes` externalization already present.

Per the no-band-aids rule, the `_dd_llmobs_tool_spans` callback param is removed in the same change once `rg` confirms no consumer across the openpaw and temper repos.

### 3. Server-side converter in Temper was rejected

An alternative design would have Temper server auto-convert Session state into OTS on Completed, without a WASM emitter. Rejected because:
- Tool spans would still need cross-turn persistence (see section 2); the converter would just move the emission point, not eliminate the persistence work.
- It bleeds openpaw-specific data shapes into platform code.
- The governed HTTP boundary Cedar relies on disappears.
- Failures are harder to observe — no HTTP trace, no state-machine-visible status field.

OTS emission stays an app-level concern, fully Temper-native through a WASM integration.

### 4. Decision atomicity: one `OTSDecision` per tool call

The `OTSDecision` struct (`temper/crates/temper-ots/src/models/decision.rs:345-442`) supports per-decision-point granularity with four `DecisionType` variants (`ToolSelection`, `ParameterChoice`, `ReasoningStep`, `ResponseFormulation`). The emitter produces exactly one decision per tool call invocation — `decision_type = ToolSelection`:

- `decision_id` = `tool_call_id` (already unique per call)
- `choice.action` = tool name
- `choice.arguments` = arguments parsed as JSON
- `choice.rationale` = the `thinking` block text immediately preceding the call in the session-tree Message entry
- `consequence.success` = `!is_error`
- `consequence.result_summary` = first 500 chars of tool result
- `consequence.error_type` = classification when `is_error`: `"tool_timeout"`, `"tool_error"`, `"cedar_denied"`, `"unknown_error"`

Reasoning steps do not become separate `ReasoningStep` decisions — they are already captured as `OTSMessage.reasoning` on the turn-level message. Parameter choice is rolled into `choice.arguments`. Response formulation is captured as the terminal assistant `OTSMessage`.

### 5. Counter-reasoning, evaluation, and credit assignment are deferred

The OTS schema includes optional fields for `OTSDecision.alternatives` (rejected options), `OTSDecisionEvaluation.counterfactual` (post-hoc "what would've been better"), `OTSDecisionEvaluation` (score + feedback), and `OTSCreditAssignment` (contribution-to-outcome). All serialize out of JSON when `None`.

Standard Anthropic / OpenRouter tool-use responses do not emit alternatives — the model returns only its chosen action. Populating `alternatives` requires changing the agent system prompt to explicitly instruct "for each tool call, list two rejected alternatives and why" — a prompt-engineering change with its own A/B evaluation cost and latency impact. Evaluation and credit assignment require a separate evaluator agent running over completed trajectories.

All four optional fields remain `None` in the initial emission. Populating them is future work tracked as separate ADRs.

### 6. Outcome derivation from terminal state

- `Completed ∧ has_result → Success`
- `Completed ∧ ¬has_result → PartialSuccess` (defensive; shouldn't occur given the `CompletedHasResult` session invariant)
- `Failed → Failure`
- `Cancelled → PartialSuccess` — user-interrupted sessions with partial work done are more useful signal than noise for evaluation agents

Serialization is snake_case per `temper-ots/src/models/enums.rs:22-29` (the enum variant is `PartialSuccess`, serialized as `"partial_success"`).

### 7. Retry policy: one automatic retry, state-machine-observable

Emission failures surface as a state change on the Session entity via three new fields:

- `trajectory_id` (string) — generated once before first POST, reused on retry for idempotency (`INSERT OR REPLACE` on the Turso side is keyed on this)
- `trajectory_emission_status` (string, initial `"pending"`) — transitions to `"emitted"`, `"emitted_degraded"` (stored, but built without some of its evidence — see section 16) or `"failed"`
- `trajectory_emission_error` (string) — last error message, or the evidence a degraded emission was missing

Three new self-loop actions from `Completed | Failed | Cancelled`:
- `MarkTrajectoryEmitted(trajectory_id, status, error)` — success path, degraded or not
- `TrajectoryEmissionFailed(error, status)` — failure path
- `RetryTrajectoryEmission` — guarded by `trajectory_retry_count < 1`, so it is a
  one-shot manual retry regardless of which status the last attempt recorded

The guest dispatches both itself. It does not lean on an `on_failure` hook, and
the trigger declares none: the kernel's callback params are `error`,
`error_message`, `integration` and `duration_ms`, none of which this Session
models, and no effect can set a string field to a literal — so a callback would
fire an action that changes nothing and leave the status at `"pending"`, which
the sweep for failed emissions does not look at. Every failure the guest can
observe (transport error on either read, non-2xx from the POST) therefore routes
through `TrajectoryEmissionFailed` with `trajectory_emission_status = "failed"`.
What remains outside its reach is a guest trap or timeout, where the module
never runs; with no `on_failure` declared the platform surfaces that as
`temper_integration_failure_dropped_total` plus an `integration_failure_dropped`
Observe event (ADR-0152), and the row stays `"pending"`. A sweep should treat a
terminal session still at `"pending"` as unemitted for that reason.

Retry is one-shot and state-machine-visible, not in-WASM retry loops. Beyond one retry, the Evolution Engine can sweep `trajectory_emission_status = "failed"` rows as an I-Record in a future track.

### 8. paw-foresight consumer via existing MCP surface

The Convergence Analyst session already has access to the `temper_get_trajectories` MCP tool. `handle_probe_done` assembles a `temper.get_trajectories(...)` fetch-instruction block per probe_agent_id and injects it into the analyst's `user_message`. Fetch-on-demand keeps the probe→analyst data path within the governed Temper API surface rather than inline splicing large JSON into the 32KB-ceiling callback param.

### 9. Turns come from the SessionEntry tree (amends section 1, 2026-08-11)

Section 1 shipped one synthetic turn per session and deferred real turn
boundaries. In production that produced trajectories with a single turn, no
messages, and an empty `decisions` array — a row that no evaluation agent and no
RL consumer can use. The deferral is now closed.

The emitter reads the session transcript (the `session_file_id` reference, which
resolves either to a TemperFS JSONL file or to the SessionEntry rows) and walks
the chain from the recorded `session_leaf_id` to the root. Each assistant entry
closes one LLM cycle, so it opens a turn; the user, tool-result, steering, and
compaction entries that precede it are that turn's prompt side. The final turn
may have no assistant entry — that is a session interrupted mid-cycle, and it is
kept rather than discarded.

When the leaf is missing or its parent chain is broken (continuation and
recovery races can push the Session field ahead of durable rows), the emitter
falls back to the newest walkable entry, then to raw file order. A damaged tree
degrades the trajectory; it does not empty it.

`turn_count` is not the turn source — it is recorded as `_session_turn_count` so
a consumer can see when the reconstructed count disagrees with the counter the
state machine kept.

### 10. Decisions are reconstructed from the transcript, with spans as enrichment (amends section 4)

Section 2 made the tool-span JSONL the sole input to decisions, and section 4
mapped one span to one decision. That made a single config flag
(`persist_tool_spans_file`, shipped as `"false"`) sufficient to empty every
stored trajectory, which is what happened. Decisions now have two independent
sources:

- **The transcript.** `tool_use` blocks on the assistant entry give the tool
  name and arguments; the `tool_result` blocks that land on the next turn give
  success and result text. Both are already persisted for the model's own
  benefit, so this path costs nothing extra and cannot be switched off.
- **The spans.** They supply wall-clock duration, and they are the only evidence
  left when a message body was externalized to TemperFS. Spans nothing claims
  still become decisions rather than being dropped.

`cause_id` is set to the `tool_call_id` on every decision. It is the join
between a decision and the observation it caused — the `tool_result` block
carrying the same id, which by construction sits on the following turn.

Span persistence is enabled in the spec and defaults to ON in the guest: a
missing config key must not silently cost the training data. The cost this
guards against is real (the span document is rewritten in full on every tool
batch), so span records are compacted before persistence — results capped at 600
characters, arguments at 2000 — and the document is capped at 256KB with an
explicit truncation marker.

### 11. Message content is referenced, not inlined

Inlining message bodies once cost roughly 300MB of a 491MB database
(`.proofs/061`). Trajectories are stored as opaque blobs and are written once
per session, so the same failure is available here.

Bodies that already live in TemperFS are emitted as file references
(`content_file_id`, `content_file_version_id`) and never fetched. Inline text is
bounded twice: 4000 characters per message and 64000 characters per trajectory,
with the dropped character count recorded so a consumer can tell truncation from
absence. Tool arguments over 4000 serialized characters collapse to a preview
plus the original size. The session's own artifacts (session tree, tool spans,
prepared context, provider response, system prompt) are listed as OTS context
resources, which gives consumers the pointers without the payloads.

### 12. Spec identity and harness

`metadata.harness` is `"temperpaw"` — the runtime that produced the run, which a
cross-harness training set has to distinguish.

`metadata.spec_version` identifies the actor spec the run executed under. The
WASM guest context exposes only config, trigger params, entity state, and ids
(`temper-wasm-sdk::Context`); it carries no spec hash, and asking the server for
one would add an HTTP round trip to every terminal transition. So the identity
is declared in the spec's own trigger config as `<app>@<version>` and travels
with the spec that declares it. A repo contract test pins that literal to
`os-apps/paw-agent/app.toml`, so the two cannot drift apart silently.

Alternatives rejected: an extra request to read the installed-app version (a
round trip per session for a value the spec already knows), and a hand-written
hash literal (drifts the moment someone forgets to update it).

### 13. Token counts always, token ids only when the serving stack sends them

Per-turn prompt and completion token counts come from the provider response and
are recorded on the assistant entry when it is written, so they are exact rather
than reconstructed. They surface as `_prompt_tokens` and `_completion_tokens`;
session totals surface as `_token_usage`. The OTS schema has no field for token
counts, and the underscore prefix marks non-standard fields the same way
`_duration_ms` already does on decisions.

`prompt_token_ids`, `completion_token_ids`, `response_mask`, and `logprobs` are
emitted with exactly those names when the pipeline recorded them, and are absent
otherwise. RL consumers need token ids because retokenizing text drifts, but no
provider is asked for them: the OpenAI-compatible and Responses stream parsers
capture them if the server streams them (flattening OpenAI's
`logprobs.content[].logprob` shape to the flat array the contract requires), the
Anthropic Messages stream carries none, and nothing issues a second request.
Malformed signals are dropped rather than passed through — a fabricated mask is
worse than a missing one.

Per-turn timestamps have the same shape of problem. The entity event log is a
hot tail that drops older events at snapshot boundaries, so it cannot date a
long session's turns. Every SessionEntry is therefore stamped with its own
`ts_ms` at creation, and the event log is only a fallback for entries written
before that stamp existed.

### 14. Tool-call ids are only unique within a turn (2026-08-11)

Providers that omit tool-call ids get a synthetic one, and the synthetic id used
to be positional (`tool_1`, `or_tool_1`), restarting with every response. Two
turns that each made one call therefore shared an id, and the emitter's
document-wide `id -> span` and `id -> observation` maps let the second call
overwrite the first: both decisions reported the second call's result, error
flag and duration.

Both halves are fixed. The synthetic id is now scoped by the provider's own
response id (`chatcmpl-…_tool_1`), and the conversion of transcript history back
to chat format scopes its fallback by message position, so one request cannot
carry the same call id twice. Independently of that, the emitter attributes
observations and spans **per turn**: observations parsed from turn K's prompt
answer turn K-1, and spans are claimed by position — the first `tool_1` span
goes to the first `tool_1` call. Repeated ids therefore cost nothing even in
rows written before the id change, and a model that reuses an id cannot collapse
two decisions into one.

### 15. Signals that are positionally aligned travel as a set (2026-08-11)

`completion_token_ids`, `response_mask` and `logprobs` are indexed by generated
token: element *i* of each describes the same token. A payload assembled from
partial data breaks that silently, and a consumer has no way to detect it.

Two gates. The OpenAI-compatible parser flattens a `logprobs.content[]` payload
only when **every** entry carries a numeric `logprob`, rejecting the payload
whole rather than skipping the bad entry and shortening the array. The emitter
then refuses to write the completion-side signals unless the ones present agree
on length, recording `_token_signals_misaligned` with the observed lengths so
the drop is visible. Prompt-side ids do not index into the completion and are
unaffected.

The truncation marker has the same shape of problem. Whether a span document was
sealed is decided from the reserved `tool_name` of a parsed record, never a
substring search — a tool that reads or greps this source returns the marker
literal in its own result, and that must not make a complete run look partial.
The seal check also stopped slicing the document at a byte offset, which trapped
the guest on any multibyte tail.

### 16. An unreadable transcript fails the emission; an absent one degrades it (2026-08-11)

A trajectory is written once and the session is then marked emitted. Emitting a
spans-only document because the transcript read returned 503 or a policy denial
would store a permanently incomplete row that no retry ever repairs, because the
session no longer looks failed.

A transcript read **error** therefore records `TrajectoryEmissionFailed` and
stops before the POST, leaving the row absent and `RetryTrajectoryEmission` (and
the Evolution Engine sweep) able to produce a complete one.

An **absent** transcript is a different thing and still emits, because a retry
cannot restore a transcript that is not there. It must not pass as complete
either. The shared reader mapped every "nothing" case to `Ok("")` — a legacy
404, a 200 with an empty body, a SessionEntries query with no rows, and a
first-turn session that has not materialized any — so the emitter could not tell
a session that never wrote history from one whose history is gone, and stored
both as if the turn structure had simply not existed.

`read_session_transcript` now returns the transcript together with a
`TranscriptPresence`, and each non-present reason (`missing_file`, `empty_file`,
`no_entries`, `pending_first_turn`, `undeclared`) reaches the stored document.
The same applies to a declared tool-span file that 404s.

Arrival is not the test, either. Every skip-and-continue in the reconstruction
path is a way for a short record to look whole, so each one now reports:

- `transcript_unparseable` — `parse_session_entries` skips lines that do not
  parse, deliberately, so one corrupted line cannot cost a whole trajectory. The
  count of skipped lines travels with the document.
- `transcript_leaf_unresolved` — the recorded `session_leaf_id` is the session's
  own claim about where its history ends. When it does not resolve, the fallback
  chain of section 9 is an older leaf, so the *newest* turns are exactly what is
  missing. That is the shape a half-written final turn takes. A cyclic ancestry
  counts as unresolved rather than as a chain that stopped early: everything
  above the loop is unreachable, so the fragment is not the leaf's history.
- `transcript_no_turns` — entries parsed but produced no turn, which yields the
  same synthetic single-turn document an empty transcript does.
- `tool_spans_unparseable` — `parse_tool_span_document` skips malformed span
  lines for the same reason, and each one is a tool call whose only evidence is
  gone.
- `token_signals_dropped` — a signal the SessionEntry writer or the trajectory
  budget refused. Both record the size they dropped; the tag is what makes the
  loss visible on the Session rather than only inside the document.

Without these, corruption, a stale leaf, or a partially written span append each
reach the same false-complete row that a 404 used to.

A degraded document carries the reason three ways, because each survives a
different consumer:

- `metadata.tags` gets `degraded:<reason>` — kernel-modeled, so it survives a
  consumer that re-serializes the row through `OTSTrajectory`. A completeness
  marker is the last thing that may be lost on a round trip: losing it turns a
  partial record into an apparently whole one.
- The document carries `_transcript` / `_tool_spans_missing` for a consumer
  reading the raw row.
- The Session reports `trajectory_emission_status = "emitted_degraded"` and
  names the missing evidence in `trajectory_emission_error`, so a sweep can find
  degraded rows without opening them. The status is derived from the document
  that was actually stored, so the entity and the row cannot disagree.

`turn_count` is deliberately not one of the checks. It counts continuations —
tool results, steering, plan resumes — not assistant messages, so it does not
equal the reconstructed turn count even on a healthy session; comparing them
would mark nearly every trajectory degraded and make the marker worthless. It
travels as `_session_turn_count` (section 9) for a consumer that wants to weigh
the two.

The single-retry guard is unchanged: it counts retries, not statuses, so a
degraded emission neither consumes nor triggers one.

### 17. Interim carriers for the fields the pinned kernel does not model (2026-08-11)

`metadata.trajectory_id`, `metadata.harness`, `metadata.spec_version`, the
per-turn token-level RL signals and `decisions[].cause_id` are the JCS contract
fields. The temper branch `claude/jcs-trajectory-core` adds all of them to
`temper-ots` as optional additive fields, but it is not on temper main — its
pull request (nerdsane/temper#415) was closed unmerged on 2026-08-12 — and the
pin in `emit_ots_trajectory/Cargo.toml` is a main revision. A bump is only
possible once that work lands, under whatever pull request supersedes #415
(repo convention: a `bump-temper` branch).

The pinned structs therefore do not declare them, and serde ignores unknown
fields — so a round-trip test proves the kernel-modeled fields and says nothing
about these. The stored row does keep them, because the server persists the POST
body verbatim (`temper-server`'s trajectories handler stores `data: body`), so
the OTS query API returns them. What loses them is a consumer that deserializes
a row into `OTSTrajectory` and writes it back.

Every one of them travels through a kernel-modeled carrier until the pin moves,
and each carrier is asserted by a test rather than assumed:

- The decision join key is `decision_id`, which the kernel does model.
  `cause_id` mirrors it rather than carrying the join alone.
- Run provenance is repeated in `metadata.tags` as `harness:temperpaw` and
  `spec_version:<app>@<version>`. `tags` is kernel-modeled, and rejected
  alternative 6 already named it as the home for harness-specific metadata.
- The token-level signals repeat as an **inventory** in `context.entities[]`
  (`type = "turn_token_signals"`), whose `metadata` is a kernel-modeled
  `BTreeMap<String, Value>` and round-trips verbatim: per turn, which signals
  the stored row holds, how many elements each has, and any misalignment or
  budget drop. `metadata.tags` also gets `token_signals:present`.

  The arrays themselves stay on the turn, under the names the JCS branch gives
  `OTSTurn`, so the pin bump is a deletion rather than a migration. Copying
  them into the carrier as well was rejected: they scale with completion length
  and reach megabytes on a long session, and duplicating that is the payload
  failure section 11 exists to prevent. What the carrier buys is that a consumer
  holding a re-serialized copy can tell its copy is incomplete instead of
  training on it as though it were whole — the loss becomes visible rather than
  silent.
- `kernel_round_trip_drops_exactly_the_unmodeled_extensions` pins the exact set
  of dropped fields, and `pinned_kernel_still_lacks_the_jcs_contract_fields`
  asserts each contract field is still dropped. The day a pin bump lands them,
  both fail, and the failure message names the removal work: delete the
  `turn_token_signals` carrier and the `token_signals:present` tag, drop the
  harness and spec_version tag mirrors, shrink `KERNEL_UNMODELED_FIELDS`, and
  amend this section.

**Follow-up (blocking on another repo):** bump the `temper-wasm-sdk` and
`temper-ots` pins in `os-apps/paw-agent/wasm/*/Cargo.toml` to a temper main
revision that carries the JCS schema work, then remove the carriers above. It
cannot be done in this pull request — no such revision exists yet — and the
gate is keyed on the pin's own contents rather than on a pull-request number,
so the interim state cannot outlive the bump quietly. CI runs the emitter's
manifest directly (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), because the os-app WASM modules
are separate workspaces and `-p temperpaw` does not reach them: a gate nothing
executes is not a gate.

### 18. Token-level signals are bounded twice (2026-08-11)

These arrays scale with completion length and are the only payload the
character budgets of section 11 do not touch, so they are bounded where they are
written and again where they are read.

At **capture**, arrays streamed under `prompt_token_ids`,
`completion_token_ids` and `response_mask` are accepted only when every element
is a number. The OpenAI-compatible endpoint is configurable per agent, so what
arrives under those names is not trusted; text there would be unbounded foreign
content sized against a budget that assumes numbers, and the emitter's own shape
checks would drop it from the trajectory regardless.

On the **SessionEntry**, `extra_json` declares
`overflow_inline_max_bytes = 131072`; past it the kernel replaces or
externalizes the *whole* field, which would take the per-turn facts — `ts_ms`,
provider, model, token counts — along with the signals that caused the overflow.
Bounding each signal at 32KiB does not bound their sum: four signals just under
that ceiling each pass and cross the entry ceiling together. The writer
therefore spends a running budget and names what did not fit as
`<signal>_dropped_bytes`. The budget counts bytes the way the kernel does —
`extra_json` is a string-typed state variable, so the ceiling applies to the
JSON encoded again as a JSON string, and counting the unescaped length would
under-measure a quote-dense value. A test pins the constant to the spec that
declares it, and another pins the measurement to that double encoding.

Choosing *which* signal to sacrifice is policy and belongs to the writer that
knows what the signals mean. The ceiling itself is an invariant, so it is also
enforced at the single boundary every writer passes through
(`session_entry_create_body` in `wasm-helpers`), which drops the largest
non-essential members until the value fits and leaves `<key>_dropped_bytes`
behind. That covers writers with no signal policy of their own — in particular
the JSONL sync path, which re-materializes extras written before any of these
bounds existed. The per-turn facts are the last thing it sacrifices, and when
they are themselves what does not fit (an oversized `stop_reason`, or so many
members that the drop markers alone hold the value over) it shortens them and
keeps a single count rather than returning a value over the ceiling: returning
one costs the entire field, which is the outcome the bound exists to prevent.
Members are measured once and dropped largest-first, because re-measuring per
drop is quadratic on an object a corrupted line can make wide.

The refusals travel forward. `<signal>_dropped_bytes` written at capture is read
back by the emitter into the same `_token_signals_dropped` record a
trajectory-budget drop produces, so a turn whose signals were refused before the
emitter saw them is distinguishable from a provider that sent none.

In the **trajectory**, signals are bounded at 1MiB across the whole document,
spent in turn order, with drops recorded as `_token_signals_dropped` on the turn
and in the kernel-modeled inventory. A dropped signal that leaves a trace is
debuggable; a silent one reads as a turn the serving stack never produced
signals for.

## Consequences

### Positive

- paw-foresight's Convergence Analyst can distinguish independent convergence from copy-paste convergence by inspecting per-probe decision traces.
- Session-level tool-call history becomes retrievable via `temper.search_history` and the OTS query API — answers questions that neither Layer 1 action trajectories nor Layer 2 OTel spans can answer alone.
- The emitter is a clean additive change: no modification to `llm_caller`, `provider_caller`, or the new `context_preparer` landed in ADR-0034.
- Retry idempotency is free because `INSERT OR REPLACE` is keyed on `trajectory_id`.
- Trajectory emission failure cannot wedge a successful session — separate integrations, separate failure domains.

### Negative

- One extra TemperFS file per session (`tool_spans_file_id`). Bounded by session turn count.
- One extra HTTP call per terminal session transition (plus potential retry).
- OTS trajectories shipped by this track don't carry counter-reasoning yet. That limits the analytical depth available to evaluation agents in the short term, but the schema remains forward-compatible when the prompt-engineering work lands.

### Neutral

- A new decision point lands on the Session entity: on terminal state, two integrations fire (`deliver_reply`, `emit_ots_trajectory`). The state machine explicitly models both.

## Verification

Per the repository's mandatory red-green TDD and end-to-end proof requirements:

- **Unit tests** — `emit_ots_trajectory` fixture test: canned Session JSONL → hand-built OTS JSON → deserializes as `OTSTrajectory` via a sibling test crate that imports `temper-ots`. Property test covers all `(status, has_result)` combinations for outcome derivation.
- **WASM dispatch harness** — `temper/crates/temper-server/tests/wasm_dispatch.rs` extended with `test_emit_ots_trajectory`: install paw-agent spec + module, create Session with fake file-ids, dispatch `FinalizeResult`, assert POST fired and `MarkTrajectoryEmitted` dispatched.
- **Local E2E** — start temper-server + paw-agent, drive one Session Created → Completed via the ODataClient pattern from `scripts/prove_cron_scheduling.py`, confirm `tool_spans_file_id` populated, `trajectory_emission_status == "emitted"`, GET `/api/ots/trajectories` returns the trajectory.
- **Turso row dump** — confirm the `data` column parses as a valid OTSTrajectory JSON.
- **Proof reports** in `.proofs/` per phase, following `.proofs/TEMPLATE.md`.

The foresight meta-loop behavioural rerun (Run 011) is explicitly deferred — that proof happens on main after merge, in a separate foresight run tracked separately from this ADR.

### Verification of the 2026-08-11 amendment (ARN-109)

- **Round trip against the kernel structs** — `emit_ots_trajectory` takes
  `temper-ots` as a host-only dev-dependency and deserializes its own output
  into `OTSTrajectory`, asserting the reconstructed turns, message roles,
  content types, decision types, and durations. A field-name or type drift on
  either side fails the build instead of storing an unreadable row. Terminal
  states other than success round-trip too. Because serde ignores unknown
  fields, the extensions the kernel does not model are pinned separately by
  `kernel_round_trip_drops_exactly_the_unmodeled_extensions` and
  `pinned_kernel_still_lacks_the_jcs_contract_fields`; their kernel-modeled
  carriers are proven lossless by
  `token_signal_inventory_survives_the_kernel_round_trip` and
  `degradation_markers_survive_the_kernel_round_trip`; and an old-row fixture
  proves the additions stayed additive (decision section 17).
- **Unit tests** — turn reconstruction from a two-cycle transcript, leaf
  fallback and parent-cycle guards, decision/observation pairing with
  `cause_id`, per-message and per-trajectory inline budgets, oversized tool
  arguments, externalized-body references, token-signal validation, timestamp
  derivation, and the RFC-3339 conversion.
- **Repo contract tests** — `crates/temperpaw/tests/ots_trajectory_contract.rs`
  pins span persistence to on, `spec_version` to `app.toml`, the OTS field names
  the kernel deserializes, the inline budget, trajectory-id idempotency, the
  requirement that every terminal action still emits, that an unreadable
  transcript fails the emission rather than degrading it, that an *absent* one
  is marked degraded rather than stored as complete, that the unmodeled fields
  travel through kernel-modeled carriers, that the round-trip runs against the
  same kernel revision the guest is built for, that both token-signal ceilings
  exist, and that no provider mints a turn-local tool-call id.
- **Bounded-write tests** — `monty_repl` span compaction and the span-file size
  ceiling, including that a truncated document still parses line by line, that
  multibyte tool output does not trap the seal check, and that a tool result
  quoting the marker does not seal the document.
- **Guest build** — every touched module rebuilt for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  (`monty_repl` for `wasm32-wasip1`); the `temper-ots` dev-dependency is never
  part of a guest build.

The live local end-to-end run (`scripts/prove_track3_ots.py` against a local
temper-server with the paw-agent app installed and real provider credentials)
gates the deploy and is recorded on the pull request, not here.

## Rejected Alternatives

### 1. Server-side converter in Temper

See Decision section 3.

### 2. Inline tool spans on Session entity

See Decision section 2. 32KB WASM visibility ceiling.

### 3. Separate `ToolSpan` entity per call

See Decision section 2. Too many round-trips for write-once data.

### 4. Per-turn incremental OTS writes (Approach B from openpaw#61)

See Decision section 1. The endpoint expects full trajectory documents.

### 5. Include counter-reasoning in the initial emission

See Decision section 5. Requires LLM prompt change; separate track.

### 6. Extend Temper's OTS schema with openpaw-specific fields

Rejected. The OTS schema is a shared platform contract (`temper-ots` crate). openpaw-specific metadata, if any, can live in `metadata.tags` without schema changes.

### 7. Fetch externalized message bodies at emission time (2026-08-11)

Rejected. A session can externalize many entries, so this is N TemperFS reads on
a terminal transition, and it puts the full bodies back into the stored blob —
the exact failure `.proofs/061` records. The emitter references the files
instead; a consumer that wants a body can read it through the governed API.

### 8. Read the installed-app version for `spec_version` (2026-08-11)

Rejected. An HTTP round trip per terminal session to learn a value the spec
already knows. See decision section 12.

### 9. Plumb a token-id request flag into provider calls (2026-08-11)

Rejected for this track. Asking providers for logprobs or token ids changes the
request, costs latency and money on every turn, and most providers in this stack
cannot return them at all. The emitter carries the fields when the serving stack
volunteers them and leaves them absent otherwise; turning them on deliberately
for a training run is a separate decision with its own cost analysis.
