//! Discord channel transport — Gateway WebSocket + REST API.
//!
//! Connects to Discord's Gateway (wss://gateway.discord.gg), receives
//! MESSAGE_CREATE events, and dispatches them as Channel.ReceiveMessage
//! actions via the Paw OData API. Watches for Channel.SendReply events
//! and delivers replies via Discord's REST API.
//!
//! This is a Paw OData API client — no dependency on paw-server internals.
