# ADR-002: Production Renderer Packaging and Result Guards

## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

`paw-media` is a core Temper app and `MediaGeneration.Generate` is intended to run entirely through entity actions and WASM integrations. Production exposed the `temper.image_generate` tool, but image requests could appear complete without a usable artifact when the runtime saw stale or incomplete media behavior. That made the state machine report success while the DM response had no file id, asset JSON, URL, or image handle.

The Codex image renderer is a WASM integration, so production images and CI must build and retain its module-local `.wasm` artifact before pruning build targets. Result callback actions also need to be reserved for the integrations that own those state transitions.

## Decision

`paw-media` WASM builds are part of the required CI and Docker production build set. The production image must build `os-apps/paw-media/wasm/build.sh` before copying `os-apps` into the runtime layer.

User-facing `MediaGeneration` permissions are limited to create, read, list, and `Generate`. `provider_auth_gate` may report auth readiness or auth failure. `openai_codex_image_generate` may record storing, final result, or provider failure.

The DM tool result renderer treats `Complete` without `ResultFileId`, `ResultPath`, or inline image bytes as an error instead of returning a successful empty image payload.

## Consequences

CI now fails before deployment if the Codex image renderer is not included in the os-app WASM build set. Production images carry the renderer artifact needed for startup reconciliation and runtime execution.

Callback state transitions are auditable from Cedar policy and tied to their owning modules. A future renderer bug cannot silently masquerade as a successful DM image response without producing an artifact.
