# paw-foresight

Domain-agnostic foresight engine. Simulates a domain's future through temporal projection — spawning independent probe agents to observe projected states, detecting convergence across probes, evolving the model through simulated time, and presenting actionable directions.

## How the Substrate Works

The Foresight Engine is a **substrate, not a pipeline**. Probes are the simulation — they project what would happen, and their convergent projections become the next step's reality. Quality emerges from structural gates: independent observation, semantic convergence detection, and direction versioning.

**Key properties:**
- Probes work independently — they MUST NOT read each other's observations
- 1 Direction per Probe — want more perspectives, run more Probes
- Directions are versioned: each step archives the old Direction, creates a revision with `parent_direction_id`
- The model evolves through simulated time via convergent projections
- Convergence is detected by a separate LLM analyst, not string matching

## Entity Types

### ForesightModel
Living knowledge graph for any domain. The `model_type` field determines the domain (software_product, knowledge_domain, business, etc.). The JSON structure is schema-free — whatever the seed agent produces.

- **States**: Created → Seeding → Active ↔ Stale
- **Key fields**: `name`, `model_type`, `signal_source_config` (domain-specific JSON), `seed_model`, `seed_provider`, `seed_soul_id`
- **Key actions**: `Seed`, `SeedComplete`, `RefreshSignals`, `MarkStale`, `Reactivate`
- **WASM**: `spawn_seed_agent` (spawns an agent session to build the knowledge graph — bitter lesson applied)

### Projection
Temporal simulation that advances through adaptive time steps. Event-driven — no polling.

- **States**: Created → Running → Complete / Branched / Failed
- **Key actions**: `Configure`, `Start`, `ProbesReady`, `ProbeStepDone`, `ConvergenceComplete`, `ProjectionUpdated`, `AdvanceStep`, `Complete`
- **WASM**: `spawn_probes`, `handle_probe_done`, `handle_convergence`, `handle_projection_updated`
- **Flow**: Start → spawn_probes → ProbesReady → (probes run) → ProbeStepDone × N → handle_probe_done → Convergence Analyst → ConvergenceComplete → handle_convergence → Model Projector → ProjectionUpdated → handle_projection_updated → AdvanceStep → (repeat)

### Observation
Probe agents record what they see in the projected state.

- **States**: Created → Confirmed → Escalated / Faded
- **Key actions**: `Record`, `Confirm` (by Convergence Analyst), `Escalate`, `Fade`

### Direction
Direction proposed by a Probe. Versioned across steps.

- **States**: Proposed → UnderReview → Implementing → Implemented → Selected / Archived
- **Key actions**: `Propose`, `Archive` (when superseded by revision), `Select` (human)
- **Fields**: `parent_direction_id` (links to previous version), `step_at`

### DirectionFeedback
Blind review feedback on Directions.

- **States**: Open → Addressed → Resolved / Reopened

## Setup

Depends on `paw-agent` for probe sessions and `paw-fs` for knowledge graph storage.

Model and provider are configured per-probe in `probe_config` (array of `{name, model, provider}`). The seed agent's model/provider are fields on the ForesightModel entity itself (`seed_model`, `seed_provider`).
